## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.

This is how you will write image code for INTERNALLY STORED images on your repo.   just FYI.

### Reflection

This was my first Onshape part and [following along with Dr. Shields made it super easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93BFUD-HAG8&feature=emb_title&scrlybrkr=5670f0b4)  I learned about 
* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* constructions lines (shortcut **Q**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* linear patterns (no shortcut)

Onshape is awesome.  I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.

## Mount

### Description
The Mount is the square piece that holds on to the base piece. It fits even on the base, with 4 holes instead of 6, matching up with it. It has the same dimensions as the Base, except it is 120 mm instead of 200.

### Reflection
I learned how to:
* Dimension with the d key
* Use the add tool for extrusion to simplify multiple sections of a part
* Add multiple assemblies in the same document

## Fork 

### Description
This is the Fork for the Caster, holding the wheel onto the base. It has a cylindrical piece with a wider cylinder on that. This has two prongs sticking out with holes in the top of those. Each edge has a filet to make it cleaner.

### Reflection

I learned that how to:
* Format a Github file with #s for boldness
* Create source links on a Github file
* The use tool for copy and pasting parts on Onshape.
