## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.

This is how you will write image code for INTERNALLY STORED images on your repo.   just FYI.

### Reflection

This was my first Onshape part and [following along with Dr. Shields made it super easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93BFUD-HAG8&feature=emb_title&scrlybrkr=5670f0b4)  I learned about 
* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* constructions lines (shortcut **Q**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* linear patterns (no shortcut)

Onshape is awesome.  I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.

## Mount

### Description
The Mount is the square piece that holds on to the base piece. It fits even on the base, with 4 holes instead of 6, matching up with it. It has the same dimensions as the Base, except it is 120 mm instead of 200.

### Reflection
I learned how to:
* Dimension with the d key
* Use the add tool for extrusion to simplify multiple sections of a part
* Add multiple assemblies in the same document

## Fork 

### Description
This is the Fork for the Caster, holding the wheel onto the base. It has a cylindrical piece with a wider cylinder on that. This has two prongs sticking out with holes in the top of those. Each edge has a filet to make it cleaner.

### Evidence

### Reflection

I learned that how to:
* Format a Github file with #s for boldness
* Create source links on a Github file
* The use tool for copy and pasting parts on Onshape.

## Tire

### Description
The Tire uses the Revolve feature on a Trapezoid, and uses fillets to round off the edges.

### Reflection

I learned how to:
* Use the revolve feature to make a circular 3d shape
* Use centerlines for revolving features
That's pretty much it, it wasn't anything difficult, but it is a cool new piece.

## Wheel

### Description
Wheel is also a revolve feature, but with an outer edge and inner circle, with 5 spokes like a normal wheel.
### Evidence

### Reflection
I learned how to:
* Use angles for constructing features to extrude (For the spokes on the wheels)
This was helpful for creating the right dimensions on the extruded cut on the wheel.
This part was somewhat difficult compared to the others, but it was alright.

## AxleCollarBearings

### Description
This is 4 different parts:
* The axle is a long cylinder, with a flat piece cut out on each end of the top for a set screw to go in place.
* The collar fits snug around the axle, with 2 holes across from each other for the set screws.
* The bearings are just two different size washers.

### Evidence
[Axle, collar, and Large Bearing](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/3323717cd26c0441020d2687/w/a98a010ac513d68620cad2e6/e/252f63e49b3d14a4f28b5906)
(The small bearing is on the part studio with the wheel and tire.)

### Image

### Reflection
This section wasn't that difficult, it just took time to make all 4 pieces.
I learned how to create a new part just using the dimensions of a different part (I did this with the mount and base, but forgot how to).
I'm wondering where the large bearing will go? It doesn't seem to fit on the axle so i wonder where it will go.
